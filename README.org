#+TITLE: pytorch-world

Thank you for interest in pytorch-nix infrastructure! This repository served
several purposes which it has outlived:

- build new pytorch derivations when nixpkgs PRs were slow. /Now, new nixpkg
  derivations are often very up-to-date/.
- host libtorch derivations for hasktorch. /This has been moved to [[https://github.com/hasktorch/libtorch-nix][hasktorch/libtorch-nix]]/.
- serve as a personal binary cache for a build-grid of pytorch. /Please join
  [[https://github.com/nix-community/nix-data][nix-community/nix-data]] and petition to have community-hosted binary caches for
  a pytorch workflow/.

This repository is now unmaintained and archived.
